- Arrangements can be made by dragging players from the player bank to each group. They can be then saved for later use.

- Fetch Arrangements will download presets from the raid leader and other raid assistants using the addon.
- Show Only Players In Raid will limit the player bank to only show players in the current raid group.
- Copy Current Raid discards the current arrangement if unsaved, replacing it with the current raid arrangement.
- REARRANGE RAID will change the groups to reflect your setup.

- /cga list - show list of available presets.
- /cga go [index] - rearrange raid based on the preset.
- /cga show - open UI.
- /cga hide - close UI.
